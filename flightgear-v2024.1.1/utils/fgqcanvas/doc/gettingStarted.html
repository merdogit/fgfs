<h2>FlightGear Remote Canvas</h2>
<p>Remote-canvas connects to a running FlightGear instance via a WebSocket
connection. FlightGear must have been started with the <tt>--httpd</tt> option.
Enter the IP address or hostname of the computer running FlightGear, and
choose the 'Query' option to select a canvas.
</p>
<p>Several canvases can be added, moved and resized. Be patient when
connecting, especially over WiFi. A configuration of canvases and their sizes
can be saved and loaded, useful for dedicated setups.</p>
<p>Press and hold on a canvas to bring up a menu for it - this allows a
canvas to be closed, or to reconnect to the FlightGear instance</p>
